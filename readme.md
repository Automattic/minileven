This plugin is based off Jetpack's Mobile Theme feature. This feature was retired in March 2020.

is meant as a **temporary workaround** you may use on your site if your theme is not responsive. **It is not supported nor maintained.**

This Mobile Theme feature was originally developed as a fall-back when most regular themes did not include a mobile view. Most themes include a mobile view by default now, so the feature is no longer necessary for most people.

**It’s very likely that your current theme is already mobile-ready.** Your theme documentation will indicate this. If you can’t find it there, you should reach out to the theme developer directly. You can also follow the directions below to do a quick test.

If you find that the theme is not mobile-ready, also known as “responsive,” it would be better to find a theme that is responsive than to use this plugin. **With Jetpack, you can choose any one of the themes available in your [WordPress.com Themes list](https://wordpress.com/themes/). These are all responsive themes.**

Responsive themes offer an easy way to set up a website that looks great on any device – that includes your desktop computer, laptop, tablet, or mobile device. In addition to loading properly on any device, the best responsive themes also perform as needed and are easy to navigate on any screen size. Responsive themes also remove the need to have a specific mobile-only theme – the theme will respond to the device viewing the content and resize the content accordingly.

**To see if your theme is mobile-ready, you can use [this Google tool](https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly).**

If your theme is not mobile-ready, you’ll need to replace it with a theme that is.

The vast majority of themes available for WordPress these days are mobile-ready (“responsive”). Here’s some information to help you find one that’s right for your site.

- The official [WordPress.org theme repository](https://wordpress.org/themes/) has many free themes that are mobile-ready. You can browse and live preview these themes from directly inside your WordPress dashboard.
- With Jetpack, you also already have access many mobile-ready themes which can be found on the [WordPress.com theme showcase](https://wordpress.com/themes/). We offer free and premium themes there.
- If your theme was custom built by a third party, you may want to reach out to them in order to make sure they prep your theme for when the Jetpack mobile theme feature is retired.
